The Isle of Man Immigration Rules, whilst not identical to the United Kingdom (UK) Immigration Rules, are based on the UK Rules and are very similar. However, they are not identical and there are some provisions within the UK Rules that do not apply here and some in the Isle of Man Immigration Rules that do not apply in the UK. There are also, as in the UK, provisions within the Isle of Man Immigration Rules that apply only to Commonwealth citizens.
