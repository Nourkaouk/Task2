While the headline planning figure has not changed since
2012–13, a number of recent policy decisions are changing the composition and
actual size of the Migration Program. The planning level itself has changed
from a target to a ceiling, as noted in Minister Dutton’s media release for the
2017–18 Budget.[4] In 2016–17, for the first
time, there was a large discrepancy between the planning level and the number
of permanent residency visas granted.[5] It may be the case future
discrepancies exist for 2017–18 and into the forward estimates period.
