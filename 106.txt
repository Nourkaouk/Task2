The planning level for the 2018–19 Humanitarian Program will
increase to 18,750 places, up from 16,250 in 2017–18. This was announced and
funded in the 2015–16 Budget.[9] This will be the second
largest Humanitarian Program since the Hawke Government.[10]
The Department of Home Affairs Portfolio Budget Statement also introduces the
word ‘ceiling’ for the Humanitarian Program.[11] This was previously not
the case. In addition, the number of places in the Humanitarian Program is not
stated, whereas it was in previous Portfolio Budget Statements.[12]
