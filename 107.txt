A number of commentators have noted the importance of
population growth, and immigration flows, to economic growth and fiscal projections
in the Budget.[16] A recent joint Treasury
and Department of Home Affairs report concluded the net fiscal impact of the
2014â€“15 migrant cohort (the Migration Program, the Humanitarian Program and
temporary skilled visa program) is $9.7 billion over 50 years.[17]
The fiscal effect of new migrants was noted by the Treasurer recently in the
context of the debate about the appropriate size of the Migration Program.[18]
