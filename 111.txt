Maybe you worry, how will we build homes and find jobs for all these people? “We” don’t. They will. Markets, not the government, already provide homes and jobs for citizens. And anyway, aren’t we supposed to be worried about our stagnant economy? Everyone wants more housing construction in the US, yet there are only so many people who need only so many houses. Imagine the construction boom from millions of additional immigrants each year. Our ancestors did not need the American Indian federal government to provide them jobs or build them houses. Neither do new immigrants.
