Another 11 million people are here, working hard, paying taxes, owning property, but scurrying around in semilegal status. They can’t really sue if swindled. They certainly can’t vote on how the society they live in works. They can’t get a driver’s license. They live in constant fear. This is a national embarrassment. We criticize other nations for “apartheid” when they deny legal status to people who have been living there for decades, or even generations. Yet one in 20 people living within US borders suffers the same fate.
