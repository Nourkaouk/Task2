BARTON: Yeah. So before we talk about the blue states in purple Arizona, the Republican-led legislature passed a Texas-style immigration law, but it was quickly vetoed by Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs. One of the biggest recent changes has been in California. Starting this year, low-income individuals in that state have access to health care regardless of their immigration status. And it's important to point out not all states removing barriers for immigrants are led by Democrats, either. A proposal in Indiana would allow nurses trained in other parts of the world to more easily get licensed in the state.
