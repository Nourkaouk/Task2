“Historically, the U.S. has resettled very small numbers of refugees from Latin America, despite the need. This part of the announcement can be a much-needed first step towards addressing that gap,” said Bilal Askaryar, interim campaign manager for Welcome With Dignity, a coalition of more than 100 immigrant rights organizations across the country. “However, advocates are gravely concerned that the system may be used in conjunction with a ban on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, and that people from Africa who do not already have access to refugee resettlement will be left in harm’s way.”
