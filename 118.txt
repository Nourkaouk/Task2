The University must comply with the provisions of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as amended, and the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, governing the employment of immigrant and nonimmigrant aliens.
Immigrants are those who have been granted permanent resident status but who are not U.S. citizens. They may engage in all forms of employment.
NonimmigrantsÂ are those who are admitted temporarily for specific purposes and periods of time. They may be employed by the University only if the DHS has authorized them to work in the U.S.
