Nonimmigrants on F-1 or J-1 visas who have been authorized to work are not subject to Social Security withholding (FICA) for a limited period of time. However, all nonimmigrants must file federal income tax withholding, even if their income is otherwise exempt from taxation. The University is required to withhold the correct amount of tax from the individualsâ€™ paychecks. If the individuals are tax exempt, they may receive a refund of all taxes withheld after filing an annual income tax return.
