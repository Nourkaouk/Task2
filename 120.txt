Departments seeking to hire candidates who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and who seek employment in the U.S. under the terms of a temporary, nonimmigrant visa (i.e. H-1B), should be aware of the anti-discrimination provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (see 8U.S.C. §1324(b)). The provisions prohibit four types of conduct:

Citizenship or immigration status discrimination
National origin discrimination
Unfair documentary practices during employment eligibility verification (Form I-9) process (document abuse)
Retaliation for filing a charge or asserting rights under the anti-discrimination provisions
