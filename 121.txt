An employer may draw lines in its decision-making that are more favorable to certain individuals. For examples, some individuals may not need sponsorship at the time because their student status or another path authorizes them to work; however, they will need sponsorship sometime in the future. In this case, an employer can make any decision on whether to hire the individuals, including the decision to hire them and then terminate employment once they are no longer authorized to work (employer would have no duty to sponsor the individual when the time comes)
