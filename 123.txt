United States laws enacted by Congress, including those in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), govern matters related to processing and issuance of visas and travel to the United States, including entry and exit of all travelers across the nationâ€™s borders. Additionally, more recent immigration laws have an impact on visa processing, including, as examples, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2002.
