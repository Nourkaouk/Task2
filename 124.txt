If you apply for a visa, a consular officer will adjudicate your application and determine whether to issue or refuse your visa in accordance with U.S. laws.  If a visa applicant has not established that he or she is eligible for a visa, the consular officer must refuse that application.  However, some refused visa applications may be refused because they require further administrative processing.  The duration of the administrative processing will vary based on the individual circumstances of each case.
