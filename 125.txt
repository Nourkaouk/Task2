Immigration was projected to be a salient issue for the Latino electorate even before the failure of the recent immigration bill, with one-fifth (20%) of Latino voters reporting that “immigration and the border” is one of the most important issues for elected officials to address in a UnidosUS national poll conducted in late 2023. If immigration emerges as a central theme during the general election, the percentage of Latino voters for whom immigration is a top voting priority will undoubtedly surge.
