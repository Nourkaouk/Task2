The immigration and foreign aid bill would have gone a long way to address votersâ€™ concerns regarding border enforcement, as it provided $20.23 billion to increase border security and change current migrant policies. This includes the eight percent of Latino voters who identified border security as one of their top issue priorities in the UnidosUS National Latino Survey from last November.1 However, the bill did not outline a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants, a policy that has much wider support among these two sub-groups of the larger electorate.
