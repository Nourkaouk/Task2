After two elections (2022 and 2020) where the economy and/or COVID-19 drowned out the impact of immigration policy on voting behavior, we may see immigration returning to the forefront of votersâ€™ minds as it did for the Obama election years of 2008 and 2012. If this happens, it is likely that the candidate who can signal to voters that they have a plan to simultaneously address border security while developing approaches to help find a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants will be rewarded with the opportunity to implement that plan as our next president.
