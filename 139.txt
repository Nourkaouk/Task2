When John F. Kennedy was elected President he realized the need to reform the immigration laws. He had written a book called A Nation of Immigrants which explained why the United States should change the National Origins Actâ€™s quota system. Kennedy proposed a bill that created a system for allowing immigrants into the country based on family ties and special skills called the Immigration and Nationality Act also known as the Hart-Cellar Act. President Johnson signed the bill into law.
