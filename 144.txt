The Immigration and Visas (IV) unit seeks to enhance access to and flexibility of safe and legal pathways and supports Member States with effective and rights-based admission, stay, and readmission solutions tailored to specific needs and contexts. Those solutions, including improved visa policy and practices, ensure the efficient functioning and streamlining of admission and readmission frameworks and are key to better manage regular migration and prevent irregular migration. For migrants, access to regular migration pathways is crucial as they are otherwise vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, including by unscrupulous brokers, and the risks related to irregular migration journeys and status.
