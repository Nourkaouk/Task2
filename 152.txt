The inclusion of carers amongst the occupations eligible under the Health and Care route was intended to be a temporary post-pandemic measure. However, continuing underinvestment in the sector and an aging population mean that this occupation is likely to remain included in at least the short to medium-term. The Home Office will be monitoring this occupation closely following the high levels of use and evidence of worker exploitation since it was included on the shortage occupation list early last year.
