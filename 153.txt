The impact of such a substantial increase to the general salary threshold is that only very senior members of many medium-skilled occupations (at Levels 3 to 5 of the Regulated Qualifications Framework) will continue to qualify, and some occupations will be priced out. This is because the new threshold corresponds to the median income for skilled roles in aggregate. It may also be above the upper end of the range for some skilled occupations, including in construction, retail, hospitality, food production and food processing.
