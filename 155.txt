The Biden administration has managed to open up sponsorship programs that allow some people from Ukraine, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Haiti to enter legally for two years if they have a U.S.-based sponsor, and the U.S. admitted tens of thousands of Afghans after the Taliban takeover of Kabul, allowing them to pursue their immigration and protection processes inside the U.S. However, these are largely ad hoc responses to immediate crises, and the U.S. legal immigration and humanitarian protection system needs broader reforms to deal with changing global circumstances.
