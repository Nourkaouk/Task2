To make sure that immigration policy succeeds and meets the challenges of the future, at least three things need to happen. First, the U.S. needs a legal immigration system that can handle the demand for workers in the country in predictable and consistent ways, which requires redesigning an antiquated immigration system largely built on the foundations of a 1965 law. Second, the U.S. needs to be able to bring down unauthorized immigration to ensure the credibility of the immigration system by channeling migration into legal pathways and more effective protection efforts.
