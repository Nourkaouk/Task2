Nearly half of immigrants (46%) say they think the Democratic Party represents the interests of immigrants at least “somewhat well,” more than twice the share who say the same about the Republican Party (20%). Immigrants across immigration statuses are more likely to say the Democratic Party represents immigrants’ interests well than the Republican Party. Three in ten say they are “not sure” about how well the Republican (33%), or Democratic (31%) Parties represent the interests of immigrants. Noncitizens are more likely to say they are “not sure” how well each of the political parties represent the interests of immigrants.
