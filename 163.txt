“I feel the whole thing about politics and immigration is like putting the immigrants as a bait. I see a lot of promises. They come to power and say we are going to do this and that for the immigrants but nothing ever happens. But I feel personally they put the immigrants as bait and of course everybody is better than Trump, which I have to agree but I don’t see any progress.” – 47-year-old Indian immigrant woman in New York
