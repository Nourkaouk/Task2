“During that Trump Administration he built his platform on being stricter on immigration specifically. He said we are going to send out ICE agents to capture all the illegal immigrants and there [were] videos in the media of people being arrested and deported. My family, although we are of legal status here, the process for getting to that point for us was very traumatic. So even though we were of legal status, we still felt scared because all that kind of very extremist stuff about anti-immigration was very scary.” – 24-year-old Korean immigrant woman in New York
