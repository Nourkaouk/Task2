Immigration came to a halt. The Trump administration suspended refugee admissions indefinitely and ended asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border. Restrictions banned the entry of almost every type of immigrant seeking to settle in the United States permanently.

That they were all implemented as executive actions raised additional concerns.
