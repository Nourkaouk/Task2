This annotated bibliography—organized chronologically—reveals the incremental policy discussions, decisions, and implementation over the first year of the pandemic. The changes were so broad ranging that we decided to focus exclusively on those explicitly connected to the pandemic during our research for this website. These sources help answer the following questions: What immigration policies affecting the entry and exit of foreigners into the U.S. changed during the first year of the pandemic? What rationales were used to implement them? What is the impact on immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees?
