Chappell, Bill. “Trump Administration To Curb Immigrants From 6 Nations, Including Nigeria,” NPR, January 31, 2020. NPR reports on the Trump administration’s extension of the so-called Muslim ban. The new policy restricts immigrant visas for citizens of Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, Eritrea, Myanmar, and Kyrgyzstan. “By putting restrictions on the six countries, the Trump administration nearly doubles the number of nations targeted by some form of travel ban,” the organization reports. One difference: “unlike the controversial travel ban on citizens of Iran, Somalia, and other countries, the new policy does not affect nonimmigrant visas.”
