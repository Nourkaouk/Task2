Rizzo, Salvador. “Trump’s Wobbly Claim That His Wall Could Stop the Coronavirus.” Washington Post, March 12, 2020.  The Post rebuts the claims by the Trump administration that building the U.S.-Mexico wall would give the U.S. a chance to stop the pandemic. Trump made these claims during a Charleston campaign rally and a right-wing activist echoed the sentiment in a tweet: “Now, more than ever, we need the wall. With China Virus spreading across the globe, the US stands a chance if we can control of our borders.”
