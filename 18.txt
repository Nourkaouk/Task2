Defining a balanced approach to immigration: The EU aims to set up a balanced approach to managing regular immigration and combating irregular immigration. Proper management of migration flows entails ensuring fair treatment of third-country nationals residing legally in Member States, enhancing measures to combat irregular immigration, including trafficking and smuggling, and promoting closer cooperation with non-member countries in all fields. It is the EUâ€™s aim to establish a uniform level of rights and obligations for regular immigrants, comparable to that for EU citizens.
