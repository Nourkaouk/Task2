Hlass, Laila L. “Why Won’t the Federal Government Release Immigrant Children?” Slate Magazine, March 31, 2020. Slate Magazine reports that “In the past week, four children in immigration detention and seven employees of the Office of Refugee Resettlement who work in children’s detention facilities in New Jersey and Texas tested positive for the virus.” Hlass, a law professor, argues that adultification whereby “children of color are perceived as more adultlike and therefore less innocent than white peers” explains why children are treated similarly to adults in the immigration legal system.
