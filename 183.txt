Lanard, Noah, and Joaquin Castro. “Immigrants In ICE Detention Face The Threat Of COVID-19.” NPR: Latino USA, April 7, 2020. This 30-minute podcast focuses on ICE detention centers and COVID-19. Noah Lanard, a reporter for Mother Jones, notes the lack of preventative measures inside the facilities.

Castro, a Congressman, notes the reversal of original ICE response on stopping immigration raids and downsizing ICE detainees; stimulus relief for Hispanic Caucus and Puerto Rico; work condition disproportionately exposing Latino workers to COVID-19.
