In Tennessee, a bill that would require authorities in the state to share information about someone's immigration status with federal counterparts is a Senate floor vote away from final passage. Another in committee would would allow judges to sentence someone in the country illegally to life without the possibility of parole for a violent crime involving a deadly weapon or on school property. A third, also in committee, would make it a misdemeanor to knowingly or recklessly transport someone who is in the country illegally into the state.
