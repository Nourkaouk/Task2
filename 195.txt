These charges masked deeper concerns: namely, that America was witnessing both a massive increase in the number of immigrants coming into the country and a change in those immigrants' countries of origin. In the 1870s, some 2.75 million immigrants entered the country; that figure nearly doubled in the 1880s, to 5.25 million. At the same time, America saw more and more immigrants coming from Southern and Eastern Europe — marking the beginning of a demographic shift away from Northern European immigration, a trend that would continue for the next 40 years with enormous social and political consequences.
