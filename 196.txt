Under the so-called Ellis Island policy regime that lasted until the mid-1920s, immigrants would arrive (with no prior visa or formal permission) at American ports, where federal officials would inspect them. As long as the immigrants did not fall under one of the explicit categories of exclusion, they could enter the country. The list of such categories included any person "likely to become a public charge," as well as the diseased, criminals, anarchists, polygamists, those with low intelligence, paupers, and prostitutes. In 1917, passing a literacy test (conducted in the immigrant's native language) was added to the entry criteria.
