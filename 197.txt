It is no coincidence that this low ebb in American immigration came at the same time as the civil-rights movement for African Americans, just as the Ellis Island period of high immigration coincided with the rise of Jim Crow segregation. During the Progressive era, reformers paid little attention to the rights of black Americans, preferring to focus instead on the problems of urban poverty, which were partially a result of high immigration. By the 1950s, however, immigration was no longer much of an issue — and so the country slowly turned its attention to righting the wrongs of legal segregation.
