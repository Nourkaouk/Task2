At the same time, lawmakers imposed the first quota system for immigrants from the Western Hemisphere. In conjunction with the end of the Mexican guest-worker program, this change made legal migration to the United States more difficult for Latin Americans, especially Mexicans. Yet illegal immigration across the massive U.S.-Mexican border remained relatively easy, and the number of illegal entrants exploded. In 1964, 86,597 illegal immigrants were apprehended and deported. By 1970, that figure had increased to 345,353; by 1975, it had reached 766,600.
