By the mid-1980s, there were an estimated 3 million illegal immigrants residing in the United States and at least 200,000 new ones entering each year, according to estimates by the Department of Justice. It was clear that Congress had to intervene. The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act sought to fix the problem with a mix of amnesty and enforcement. Many people in the country illegally would be allowed to legalize their status, while sanctions were placed on employers who knowingly hired illegal immigrants.
