Those changes have involved a huge increase in the overall scope of legal and illegal immigration. Between 1960 and 1969, 3.2 million people immigrated to the United States legally. Between 2000 and 2009, the number was just over 10 million, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Nearly 13% of Americans are now foreign-born — roughly the same percentage as at the height of the early-20th-century immigration explosion. Far from stabilizing the size and origins of the immigrant population in America, the Hart-Celler system has made that population extraordinarily difficult to regulate.
