As announced in its 2020 work programme, the Commission published its New Pact in September 2020, which aims to integrate the asylum procedure in overall migration management, linking it with pre-screening and return, while also covering the management of external borders, stronger foresight, crisis preparedness and response coupled with a solidarity mechanism, and external relations with key third countries of origin and transit (4.2.2). The latter includes a Commission recommendation to develop complementary legal pathways to protection, such as resettlement and other forms of humanitarian admission such as community sponsorship programmes, but also pathways linked to education and work.
