Council Directive 2003/86/EC sets out provisions on the right to family reunification, which go beyond the right to respect for private and family life of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Given that the 2008 implementation report concluded that Directive 2003/86/EC had not been fully and correctly applied in the Member States, the Commission published a communication in April 2014 providing guidance to the Member States on how to apply it. The Commission’s legal migration fitness check also covers the family reunification directive.
