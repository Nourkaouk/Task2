In 2022, Canadian polling firm Léger found that about half of all Canadians surveyed felt the government’s target of five hundred thousand immigrants a year is too high, while 75 percent expressed concern that more immigration will result in excess demand for housing and social services. Nonetheless, several Canadian cities have sanctuary-city and “access without fear” policies that limit police cooperation with immigration authorities and guarantee undocumented people public services. Officials also rarely enforce a law banning Canadian companies from hiring undocumented workers.
