President Biden’s immigration policies have varied. He reversed many of Trump’s actions, such as the freeze on green cards enacted in late 2020. In addition, his administration has reinstated TPS for Haitians; extended benefits to several other countries, including Afghanistan and Ukraine; and raised the annual refugee admissions cap to 125,000 for fiscal year 2023. However, Biden has also imposed stricter requirements on  crossings at the southern U.S. border by proposing new asylum restrictions and increasing expulsions under Title 42, a pandemic-era public health order.
