In 2022, over 1 million, or almost half (45%), of all migrant encounters at the border were under Title 42 authority. A vast majority (89%) of the Title 42 expulsions were of single adults. Research shows Title 42 expulsions have negatively impacted the health and well-being of migrant families. Physicians suggest that being in close proximity with other individuals while being temporarily detained or transported back to Mexico, lack of medical screenings, and lack of provision of necessary medication can all have adverse impacts on physical and mental health.
