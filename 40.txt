U.S. immigration law criminalizes immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers through a series of unjust laws and increasingly harsh penalties imposed not only on those entering the United States in the hopes of a better life, but on those members of the community without citizenship who have also endured mistreatment and racial profiling in the criminal legal system. The punishment for these crimes includes incarceration and deportation, both of which tear communities and families apart. The Trump administrationâ€™s abuses have exposed serious injustices long embedded in U.S. immigration and criminal legal systems.
