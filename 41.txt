Regardless of status, immigrants are frequently unjustly and doubly penalized in their interactions with the criminal legal system. An ever-growing patchwork of laws impose harsh penalties on immigrants who have been involved in the criminal legal system, including the possibility of detention without the opportunity to seek bond and automatic deportation to dangerous or unfamiliar countries. When combined with discriminatory, racist policing practices that target communities of color, these laws put immigrant communities at constant risk of detention, deportation and family separation.
