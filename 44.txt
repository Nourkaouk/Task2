The government wastes vast resources on federal criminal prosecution and incarceration of immigrants. U.S. Marshals have reported to Congress that significant costs are associated with zero tolerance implementation of migration related prosecutions, with court operations increasingly costly and immigrants languishing for longer and longer periods in U.S. Marshals custody. The incarceration costs alone for improper entry and re-entry prosecutions have cost taxpayers more than $7 billion over the last decade. Most of that spending went to powerful private prison companies.
