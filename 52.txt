 An immigration system that meets our economic needs will not only allow needed workers to come here today, but will also adjust to our changing economy each year based on objective data.  According to the American Immigration Council, research indicates that increasing H-1B specialty occupation visas could create an estimated 1.3 million new jobs and add approximately $158 billion to gross domestic product in the United States by 2045.  Static and arbitrary immigration quotas—last established in 1990—prevent our economy from welcoming hardworking, talented individuals who will make great contributions.
