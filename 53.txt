According to DHS data, the estimated 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States in 2018 accounted for approximately 3 percent of the nation’s population.  The Pew Research Center found that in 2017, nearly 5 percent of the American workforce was not authorized to work.  Such numbers are clear indicators that the current immigration system is broken and must be fixed.  The government should use cutting-edge technology to enhance national security, ensure an orderly border and improve the administration of immigration laws.
