Under the British North America Act, constitutional responsibility for immigration is divided between the provincial	and federal governments. However, for most of Canada's history, Ottawa has dominated this policy area, although Ontario since the Second World War, Quebec	since the mid-1960s, and British Columbia since 2010, have been particularly concerned with immigration.  As of 2017, all provinces and some territories	have agreements with Ottawa allowing them to select and recruit immigrants based on their social and economic needs.  Quebec is, however, by far the province who exercises the most autonomy in the field of immigration policy.
