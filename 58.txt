The federal government also applied increasingly arbitrary restrictions on the basis of race and religion. In 1911 the government considered banning Black immigrants, but ultimately did not follow through with the idea. Arbitrary restrictions on South
	Asian migration to Canada in the early 20th century culminated in the events surrounding the passengers of the SS Komagata Maru who challenged these discriminatory
	and exclusive policies. In 1939, Jewish refugees fleeing from Nazi Germany abord the MS St. Louis	were denied entry into Canada on arbitrary grounds related to their Jewish backgrounds.
