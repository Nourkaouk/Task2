In 1979, Canada embarked on a unique program allowing private groups (most often churches and ethnic community organizations) to sponsor refugee individuals or families, bring them to Canada as permanent residents, and assist them in settling here. As
	of 2017, the Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program has settled more than 275,000 people in Canada â€“ over and above government-assisted refugees. Despite the program's success, it has been criticized in recent years for cumbersome paperwork and delays,
	and for growing restrictions on where refugees can be sponsored from. (See Canadian Refugee Policy.)
