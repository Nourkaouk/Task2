In 2021 the Government of Canada welcomed the most new immigrants in a single year in its history, with 401,000 new permanent residents. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s Minister, the Honourable Marco Mendicino announced October 30, 2020, that Canada plans to welcome over 1.2 million new immigrants over the next three years. Canada’s immigration quota calls for 411,000 in 2022 and 421,000 in 2023. Temporary resident visa approvals, for business and personal purposes, have also bounced back in 2021, and that trend is expected to continue into 2022.
