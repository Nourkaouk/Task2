Hiring a lawyer can remove much of the uncertainty and anxiety from the process. There is no one-size-fits-all immigration solution. Which of the many immigration channels available is right for you depends on your unique situation. An experienced immigration lawyer, with in-depth knowledge of Canadaâ€™s evolving immigration policies and requirements, can ensure that you meet the eligibility requirements and that you have all of the documentation you will need for each application step. Your lawyer can minimize the chance of surprises at the point of entry, and go to bat for you if your application is refused (rejected).
