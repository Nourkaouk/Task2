We offer services that address all aspects of Canadian immigration, from the initial assessment and consultation, completion and processing of the application, to appeals to the Immigration Appeal Division on refusals, as well as judicial reviews of government decisions at the Federal Court of Canada. Our team of immigration lawyers and regulated immigration consultants are aware of the frequency with which visa officers unjustly refuse a Canadian Study Permit, and we are equipped to respond accordingly. In just four years, we have overturned 5,000 decisions.
