If you have a legitimate fear for your life upon returning to your home country, we can help with the legal processes involved in applying for refugee status. It is important to note however that Refugee Applications are only for those with a legitimate claim; our immigration lawyers DO NOT engage in fabricating stories to help clients stay in Canada. The affidavits and statutory declarations we help you prepare MUST be true and reflect the facts of your situation. If clients misrepresent facts in order to secure a favourable decision, they might become inadmissible to Canada for life.
