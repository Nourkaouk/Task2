Immigration refers to the movement of persons into a new country with the intention to reside in that country. This includes state sanctioned immigration (sometimes referred to as “legal immigration”) and unlawful immigration (sometimes referred to as “illegal immigration”). It does not include persons traveling to the country for an explicitly temporary purpose, such as tourists, students on exchange programs, temporary workers, or travelers passing through a country only as means to get to their intended destination (for example, entering the country for the purpose of catching a connecting flight to the destination country).
