The quantity of immigrant visas is controlled by Congress as outlined in the Immigration Act of 1990. This sets a limit on the number of total immigrant visas that may be issued, the number of immigrant visas of each type that can be issued, and the number of visas that can be issued to immigrants of any single country of origin. These limits are often the subject of criticism for being poorly suited to the needs of the United States.
