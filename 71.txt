Those with immigrant visas may live and work in the United States, and may eventually apply to become a citizen, should they so choose. Immigrants who live in the United States without legal immigration status, referred to as undocumented immigrants, are generally not able to gain legal status or citizenship while they remain inside the United States. Although sometimes these individuals are referred to as illegal immigrants, that term is often considered pejorative. Undocumented immigrants risk facing deportation from the United States unless they make a valid asylum claim or receive temporary protected status.
