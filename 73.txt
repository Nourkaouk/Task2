Biden said that he planned to raise the annual refugee admissions to 125,000 in fiscal year 2022,[33] but on April 16, 2021, he signed an executive order maintaining the historically low cap on refugees set by the Trump administration (15,000 per year).[34] Facing criticism over the decision, the administration backtracked and announced plans to increase the refugee cap by May 15.[35] As of April 2021, Biden was on track to accept the fewest refugees of any modern president, resettling only 2,050 refugees at the halfway point of fiscal year 2021.[36]
