When the congressional debate over immigration began in 1924, the quota system
                    was so well-established that no one questioned whether to maintain it, but
                    rather discussed how to adjust it. Though there were advocates for raising
                    quotas and allowing more people to enter, the champions of restriction
                    triumphed. They created a plan that lowered the existing quota from three to two
                    percent of the foreign-born population. They also pushed back the year on which
                    quota calculations were based from 1910 to 1890.
