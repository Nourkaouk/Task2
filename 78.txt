The Immigration Act of 1910 expanded the list of prohibited immigrants and gave the government greater discretionary authority concerning the admissibility and deportation of immigrants. Immigrants determined to be “unsuited to the climate or requirements of Canada” were prohibited, as were those sponsored by charitable institutions. Decision-making power remained concentrated in the executive branch of government; courts and judges were barred from reviewing, reversing or otherwise interfering in the decisions of the minister responsible for immigration and the proceedings of the boards of inquiry.
