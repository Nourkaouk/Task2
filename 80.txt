One interesting feature of the U.S. legal system is that many challenges to immigration laws, rules, regulations, and policies are decided by the administrative agencies themselves, rather than by judges who are part of the judicial branch of government. Congress has said that in certain instances, there is no way to appeal the final decision of an administrative agency. In other instances, judges are bound to follow the agency's interpretation of the law even if they disagree. All of this restricts a federal judge's ability to change the law in certain areas.
