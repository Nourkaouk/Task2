BPCâ€™s Immigration Project provides objective and fact-based analysis and reporting on the current state of U.S. immigration policy, including the economic, humanitarian, international, and security aspects of the issue. Through close examination, and active collaboration with both sides of the aisle via direct engagement, roundtables and events, the project develops evidence-based policy recommendations for future-looking, fair, productive, and bipartisan reforms to the immigration system. Our work reaches diverse audiences within and outside of Congress, elevating the immigration debate from partisan talking points, and moving our country closer to a better-functioning immigration system.
