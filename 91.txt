For all the complexity of global immigration policy—dozens of visa types per country, each regulated by obscure requirements—this split still underpins most legal frameworks. Voluntary migrants are those who move to advance their career and socioeconomic status on labor visas, join relatives on family visas, enroll in an educational program on student visas, or invest in a new market on entrepreneur visas. Meanwhile, forced migrants move because their lives are endangered; persecution qualifies them for admission and refuge under international law.
