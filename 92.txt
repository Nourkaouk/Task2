The nature of global migration today is changing, and policy is struggling to keep up. The many people seeking to cross the borders of the United States or the European Union are neither voluntary migrants nor entitled to refuge. They are forced migrants who don’t qualify for refugee status. Because there are few legal pathways for them to enter destination states, borders are becoming harder to control, reactionary nativism is rising, and tragedies such as last week’s shipwreck in the Mediterranean are becoming more likely. It doesn’t have to be this way.
