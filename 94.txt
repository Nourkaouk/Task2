Second, governments can pursue more temporary migration programs that acknowledge acute humanitarian emergencies and accommodate nonrefugee forced migrants while preserving the state’s ability to repatriate immigrants when conditions demonstrably improve. One example of this is the temporary protected status designation in the United States, which grants legal residency to foreigners already in the United States when inhumane conditions endanger their return to countries of origin. The European Union’s own temporary protection directive—introduced in the wake of the Yugoslav Wars—has been much more limited, applying only to ostensible refugees, including Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion last year.
