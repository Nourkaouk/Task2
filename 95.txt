Temporary labor migration schemes have grown in recent years, largely driven by governments that acknowledge demographic crisis and pressing labor shortages but lack the political capital or desire to commit to permanent visas. This is the logic behind Japan’s 2019 expansion of its immigration program to include more foreign trainees. This approach—in which immigration regimes focus on temporary visas without access to citizenship—could similarly be applied to people in dire straits. However, these temporary programs do not acknowledge that complex emergencies often make repatriation impossible or at least unethical.
