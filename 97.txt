Research on wages are also broadly supportive of immigration. Contributions of immigrants across all skill levels leads to a higher median wage, but that increase might affect different groups by skill level. One analysis of wages from 1994 to 2007 indicates that, among native-born U.S. workers, those without high school diplomas saw between an 0.7 percent decrease and a 0.3 percent increase in wages. Native-born U.S. workers with a high school degree or more, representing more than 90 percent of workers, saw only increases in wages.
